In this part of Assignment 2, your task is to implement a transformer, and run several experiments with it using the Wikitext-2 dataset.

The Wikitext-2 dataset is provided under the data directory.

You need to implement the forward function in the TransformerBlock class. you need to implement the self-attention, residual connection, position-wise feed-forward network, drop out and layer normalization.

Framework code for training the model is found in notebook.ipynb.

You need to install torch and numpy in order to successfully run the code
