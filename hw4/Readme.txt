In this coding assignment, you are requested to implement the Conditional GAN to make your model generates some MNIST images given the numbers you want.
In detail, you need to implement the generator and the discriminator part.
You will notice that the framework here is quite similar to assignment 3.
But now, both the generator and the discriminator additionally take the numbers you want as input.
You can build upon your last implementation.
Fill the code in the file model.py and train the model.
The entrance of this project is the file GAN.ipynb. The training loop can be find in train.py

You need to install torch and matplotlib to run this code. Run the following commands to install them.
pip install matplotlib
pip install torch
